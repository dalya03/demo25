# Project Setup and Running Guide

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Latest LTS version recommended)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Steps to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository (If applicable)
If your project is stored in a repository, clone it using:
```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command in the terminal to install all necessary dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```
This will read the `package.json` file and install all required packages listed in `dependencies` and `devDependencies`.

### 3. Start the Project
Run the following command to start the project:
```sh
npm start
```
This will execute the script defined under `"start"` in `package.json`, typically running a development server.

### 4. Open the Project in the Browser
Once the server starts, open the following URL in your web browser:
```
http://localhost:8000
```
If the project runs on a different port, check the terminal output for the correct URL.

## Additional Notes
- If you encounter permission errors while installing dependencies, try running `npm install` with `sudo` (Linux/macOS) or as an administrator (Windows).
- To stop the server, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.
- If `npm start` does not work, check `package.json` for the correct start script and dependencies.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
