How the Code Works (Brief Explanation)
Server Setup:

The code uses Express.js to create a web server.
It listens on a specified port (8000 by default).
Static files can be served from the public directory.
Endpoints:

/: Returns "Hello World".
/tmp/poem: Returns a predefined poem.
/tmp/quote: Returns a random inspirational quote from a list.
/tmp/sum/:a/:b: Accepts two numbers in the URL, calculates their sum, and returns it.
Error Handling:

If invalid numbers are passed to /tmp/sum/:a/:b, the server responds with an error message.
HTTP Codes:

Uses status codes like 200 OK for success or 400 Bad Request for invalid input.
How to Run the Code
Install Node.js:

Make sure Node.js is installed on your system. Download it from nodejs.org.
Prepare the Project:

Save the code to a file, e.g., server.js.
Make sure the httpCodes.mjs file exists and contains proper HTTP status codes (or replace with hardcoded values like 200).
Install Dependencies:

Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.
Run:
bash
نسخ
تحرير
npm init -y
npm install express
Start the Server:

Run the server:
bash
نسخ
تحرير
node server.js
Access the Server:

Open your browser and visit:
http://localhost:8000 for the root endpoint.
http://localhost:8000/tmp/poem for the poem.
http://localhost:8000/tmp/quote for a random quote.
Use tools like Postman or curl for the POST request to /tmp/sum/:a/:b.
